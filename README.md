Examples
Here are a few examples of the patterns you can create using this repository:

1. Pyramid Pattern
java
Copy code
public class PyramidPattern {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int rows = 5;
        for (int i = 1; i <= rows; i++) {
            for (int j = rows; j > i; j--) {
                System.out.print(" ");
            }
            for (int k = 1; k <= (2 * i - 1); k++) {
                System.out.print("*");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
2. Diamond Pattern
java
Copy code
public class DiamondPattern {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int rows = 5;
        for (int i = 1; i <= rows; i++) {
            for (int j = rows; j > i; j--) {
                System.out.print(" ");
            }
            for (int k = 1; k <= (2 * i - 1); k++) {
                System.out.print("*");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
        for (int i = rows - 1; i >= 1; i--) {
            for (int j = rows; j > i; j--) {
                System.out.print(" ");
            }
            for (int k = 1; k <= (2 * i - 1); k++) {
                System.out.print("*");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
